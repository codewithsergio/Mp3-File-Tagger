# Mp3-File-Tagger
This windows desktop application is able to tag mp3 files with the year of the song and whether or not it is an explicit song using the Spotify API.
The application uses the title and author on an mp3 file to search for the release year from the spotify api.

You can browse through their files and select multiple files to tag.
